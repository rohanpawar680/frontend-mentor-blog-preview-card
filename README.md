- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to effectively use media queries to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. I also gained a deeper understanding of how to implement transitions to create a smooth user experience.

One of the key takeaways was the importance of writing professional HTML and CSS code. I made sure to use semantic HTML5 markup and follow best practices for CSS organization and naming conventions.

Here's an example of how I used media queries to change the font-size of the blog preview card on smaller screens:

```
@media (max-width: 400px) {
  .text-preset-1 {
    font-size: 20px;
  }

  .text-preset-2 {
    font-size: 14px;
  }

  .text-preset-3 {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

```

I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects and continue to improve my frontend development skills.
